I am Prateek Gianchandani. I have interests in Exploit Development, Mobile and Browser Security, and i am also the founder of <a href="https://8ksec.io">8ksec.io</a>. I have spoken/trained at Conferences like Blackhat USA, Defcon, Brucon, PHDays, Owasp Appsec USA, Hack in Paris, x33fcon etc. I enjoy climbing mountains and have climbed 4 peaks over 6000 metres. Going to the mountains is going home :). Apart from that i enjoy skiing, hiking and sometimes diving.  I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee in 2011.
